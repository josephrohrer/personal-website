Your content strategy is good, but it doesn't give me all of the information that I need to understand what you want to do with your site. While it does lead into the sections of the site, which contain information about what the site itself is going to incorporate, I don't know what your goal is. Are you trying to get hired with this site? Is it just meant to showcase your work? Are you doing this site for someone else? Specify that.

I'm guessing your navbar is going to have anchor tags? It is single page, so are you just trying to have the user able to scroll through the page when they click on one of these?

Your welcome section looks good on both mobile and desktop. This is a common template, but it looks great. If you can, think about ways to make yours unique from others. 

Your About Me section is good, but I would suggest limiting this to personal and profesional info about yourself, and having your work experience elsewhere. Maybe think about having a downloadable resume somewhere on the page? Your technical skills should also go in its own section. Atleast create a box for them, and include the languages you are proficient in, or just logos for each of these languages to keep it simple. 

Portfolio looks good. I like your idea, but you may also want to use an image slider. The Bootstrap framework does have an image slider included, but it's not that great. If this is a feature you're interested in having on the site, take a look at the Flickity Slider, the Owl Carosel or Slick. These are only a few of many available slider options out there, and these are mobile/touch friendly.

Contact form is good. For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward. http://fontawesome.io/


Great job on your wireframes.

### You've passed Milestone 2a in Tier IV. Great job.
